    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>Our journey began in 2024 when our founder, Mokgabo decided to turn a passion for baking into a business. It all started with her baking for family and friends at home, trying out different flavors, textures, and techniques and towards the end of 2024, the dream of a bakery came to life. Today, we are proud to be working with her, serving Block 6 and neighbouring places with a variety of baked goods made from the finest ingredients.</p>
